# CSC 109 Template

To use for yourself you may want to make several changes:
- Set the CXXTEST directories in `CMakeLists.txt`
- Rename files to be appropriate for what you are doing
- License with your own license
- Set paths in .vscode/c_cpp_properties.json
- Remove this file

No credit to me is required.
